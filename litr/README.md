## Building R Packages with Literate Programming (LitR)

The [LitR-Project](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project) provides a framework for building R packages in the literate programming style. Practically, this framework provides a way to organize R code into a series of markdown files, which are then compiled into a single R package.

[examples](./examples/) contains the starter-kit example from the [LitR package](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project/tree/main).
